# Overview

A sketch for [M5Stack Core2](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/core2).

m5core2_mawaranai_sushi is a program showing nonrotation-sushi.

M5Stack Core2 does not have a compass. I guess that M5.IMU.getAhrsData() of its library calculates yaw angle based on gyroscope sensor. So sushi will be drift, actually. :)
